## Module 2 – Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) in Java

This module focused on strengthening **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** skills in Java through  
**hands-on practice**, **real-world problem modeling**, and **structured code organization**.  
Each day built progressively on core OOP principles while following proper **Git & GitHub workflows**.

## Day 2 – Constructors, Access Modifiers & OOP Practice  
**Date:** 27-Dec-2025

- Strengthened understanding of constructors and access control mechanisms.
- Focused on writing modular, readable, and reusable Java code.
- Applied best practices for class design and packaging.

### Constructor Practice

- Parameterized constructors  
- Constructor chaining  
- Copy constructors  

### Programs Implemented
- Book Management System  
- Hotel Booking System  
- Library Book System  
- Car Rental System  

### Instance vs Class Variables
- Product Inventory System  
- Online Course Management  
- Vehicle Registration System  

### Access Modifiers Practice
- University Management System  
- Book Library System with EBook subclass  
- Bank Account Management System  
- Employee Records with Manager subclass

##  Day 3 – Static, Final & Object Behavior  
**Date:** 29-Dec-2025

- Learned how `static` members are shared across objects.
- Used the `final` keyword to enforce constants and immutability.
- Applied `instanceof` to verify object types at runtime.

### Practice Programs
- BankAccount  
- Book  
- Library  
- Company  
- Patient  
- Product  
- Student  
- Vehicle  

### OOP Principles Applied
- Encapsulation  
- Proper class design  
- Method implementation

## 📅 Day 4 – Object Modelling & Class Diagrams  
**Date:** 30-Dec-2025

Focused on **Object-Oriented Design (OOD)** and system modeling using UML.  
Emphasis was placed on identifying relationships and visualizing system structure before implementation.

### Concepts Practiced
- Object Modelling  
- Object-Oriented Design Principles  
- Association, Aggregation, and Composition  

### Diagrams Covered
- Class Diagrams  
- Object Diagrams  
- Sequence Diagrams  

### Problems Solved
- Library and Books (Aggregation)  
- Bank and Account Holders (Association)  
- Company and Departments (Composition)  
- Hospital, Doctors, and Patients (Association & Communication)  
- University Management System  
- School Results Application  
- Grocery Store Bill Generation Application  
- E-commerce Platform (Orders, Customers, Products)

## Day 5 – OOPs Inheritance (All Types)  
**Date:** 31-Dec-2025

- Studied inheritance as a mechanism for code reuse.
- Implemented method overriding in derived classes.
- Observed runtime polymorphism through inheritance.

### Types of Inheritance
- Single Level Inheritance  
- Multilevel Inheritance  
- Hierarchical Inheritance  

### Key Notes
- Constructors invoked using the `super()` keyword.
- Access modifiers control visibility in subclasses.
- Inheritance improves scalability and maintainability.

## 📅 Day 6 – OOP Principles: Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Interfaces & Abstract Classes  
**Date:** 01-Jan-2026

### Encapsulation
- Used private variables to protect data.
- Implemented getters and setters with validation.
- Designed immutable classes where applicable.

### Polymorphism
- Leveraged interfaces for flexible behavior.
- Used runtime method binding.
- Avoided unnecessary type casting.

### Interfaces
- Defined clear contracts for shared functionality.
- Implemented multiple interfaces when required.
- Preferred composition over inheritance.

### Abstract Classes
- Shared common logic across related classes.
- Combined abstraction with implementation effectively.
- Avoided deep inheritance structures.

### Practice Summary
- Solved multiple OOP-based Java problems.
- Followed clean coding standards.
- Focused on maintainable and readable code.
