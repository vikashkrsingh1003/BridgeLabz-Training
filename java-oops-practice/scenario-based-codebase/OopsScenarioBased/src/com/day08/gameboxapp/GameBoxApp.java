24. "GameBox – Mobile Game Distribution Platform"
Story: 
	● GameBox offers mobile games for download and purchase with features like demos, reviews, and leaderboards.
Requirements:
	● Game class: title, genre, price, rating.
	● User class with list of owned games.
	● Interface IDownloadable: download(), playDemo().
	● Constructors to set up free or paid games.
	● Use operators to apply seasonal offers.
	● Encapsulation: user-owned game data protected.
	● Inheritance: ArcadeGame, StrategyGame from Game.
	● Polymorphism: playDemo() behaves differently per genre.
